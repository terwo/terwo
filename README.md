<h3>Hey there, Iâ€™m Franklin (he/him) ðŸ‘‹</h3>

## ðŸŒ± Experience 
I am a 5th-year Cognitive Systems student at UBC. I've worked previously at the [UBC Cloud Innovation Centre](https://cic.ubc.ca/), [Sparkle AI](https://www.sparkleai.co.jp/ja/about), and most recently the [Human-AI Interaction Lab @ UBC](https://hai.cs.ubc.ca/). I also completed a 1-year exchange at the University of Tokyo.

## ðŸŒƒ Interests

I am interested in the intersection of computer science and linguistics, and wish to explore how to apply linguistic theory to create meaningful language technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy learning languages and engaging in intercultural communications. I am fluent in Japanese, proficient in Mandarin, and can still read some French.
